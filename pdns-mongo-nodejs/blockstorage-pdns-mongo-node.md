### Example to illustrate how a VSI can use Block Storage as data volume to store mongo db data.   

The intent of this article is to walk you through the process that are involved in setting up a virtual server instance (VSI) with block storage as data volume to store mongo db data in the IBM Cloud VPC.

After the setup, you can configure private dns in the server VSI and connect to mongo db from a client VSI that is running nodejs application. The client and server will communicate using Private DNS (p-DNS).

The example below illustrates how a Virtual Server Instance in IBM Cloud VPC can use Block Storage as data volume to store mongo db data.
