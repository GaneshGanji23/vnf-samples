In the above setup, each F5 LB has 4 interfaces. This applies to a generic VNF as well.

* Management: Used for configuring the LB instance - subnet 10.0.240.0/24. Usually this subnet will need a public gateway so that the instance can connect to the public network for licensing purposes.
* HA: Used for clustering and monitoring the status of the pair - subnet 10.0.241.0/24.
* External/VIP: Receives traffic from applications targeting a Virtual IP Address (VIP) subnet. Each instance gets an (self) IP Address from this subnet. The VIP (separate from the self) is associated with the active instance in the HA pair. In this example the VIP also resides in subnet.
* Internal/Work: Distributes traffic amongst backend servers. Each instance gets an (self) IP Address from subnet. The backend servers receive traffic from a VIP (separate from the self) in subnet.
